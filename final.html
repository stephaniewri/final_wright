			<h2> The Effect of Sex Education on Teen Pregnancy Rates in the United States </h2>
			<h4> In this investigation, I examine how requirements for sex education influence teen pregnancy rates across different states. <br>By Stephanie Wright </h4>
		</section>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>	
			<p>For the final project, I built upon my analysis of teen birth rates in the United States and examined the effect that sex education requirements have on teen birth rates across the United States. I used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for teen birth rates and the Guttmacher Institute for sex education requirements for states. Going into my analysis, I hypothesized that the average teen birth rates in states that do not require sex education would be higher than the average teen birth rates in states that do require sex education. Also, I hypothesized that in the Northeastern region of the United States, which is a largely Democratic area in terms of politics and state legislatures, the average teen birth rate would be lower than the rest of the country. <br>
			Teen pregnancy and birth rates are a public health issue that has been studied by several entities before. New York University published a study containing data on teen births from 1996 to 2016, comparing teen birth rates in counties that did and did not receive federal funding for comprehensive sex education. This study found that in counties that received federal funding for comprehensive sex education, there was a 3% overall reduction in the amount of teen births. This study also found that the highest teen birth rate was in 1991, when the rate peaked at 61.8 live teen births per 1,000 live births. The national average rate now is 16.8 according to my analyses, making it 3.67 times lower than the 1991 rate peak, or a 72% decrease. <br> 
			According to the CDC, teen pregnancies are at a higher risk to result in preterm birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality. Teen parents are more likely to drop out of school. Children who are born to teenagers are more likely to underachieve academically and also become teen parents themselves. In order to prevent these health complications and socioeconomic issues of teen parenthood, comprehensive and medically accurate sex education must be implemented in all states. <br>

			<h3>Data & Methodology</h3>
			<p>After downloading datasets from the CDC and the Guttmacher Institute, I constructed a dataset to perform data analysis on. I created pivot tables to find the average teen birth rate in the United States and in the Northeast, the average teen birth rates and total numbers of teen births in states that do and do not require sex education in general, and in states that do and do not require medically accurate sex education. The data that I used comes with some limitations. The data from the CDC for average teen birth rates by state is for the age group 15-19 years old, so teenagers aged 13-14 are excluded. Additionally, the average teen birth rate is measured in live teen births per 1,000 live births, so there is no data about how many teen pregnancies end in termination by abortion or in stillbirth. The data from the CDC as from 2019, which was the most recent available data, so while still recent and relevant for analysis, it is not as recent as it could have been. Teen birth rates could also have been impacted from 2020-2021 in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic when most schools were not meeting in person and many families were locked down in their homes, which could have impacted the number of teen pregnancies. The data from the Guttmacher Institute does not have a clear year that it is from, and does not clarify if the data on the website is updated regularly to reflect new legislation. Additionally, there are a few states that had no data available: Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. There is no data about the sex education requirements of these states to include in the data analysis and corroborate results with. After obtaining my findings, I created two mapped graphs with Datawrapper to visually illustrate the results of the data analysis. The graphs each show the teen birth rates in states and whether or not states require sex education, respectively.

			<h3>Findings</h3>
			<p>Below are the findings I obtained through my analysis using Google Sheets.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The average teen birth rate in the United States is 16.8 (nearly 16.9), which is higher than the CDC estimated average teen birth rate of 16.7. </li>
				<li>States that do require sex education had an average of 1,667.7 less teen live births than states that do not require sex education (in 2019, for age group 15-19).</li>
				<li>II states that require medically accurate sex education, the teen birth rate is 13.5, meaning there is an average of 13.5 teen live births per 1,000 live births. This average is 4.5 teen live births per 1,000 live births less than the average amount of teen births per 1,000 live births in states that do not require medically accurate sex education (18), and 4 teen live births per 1,000 live births less than the average of states that do not require sex education (17.5).</li>
				<li>In the Northeastern region of the United States, where most states have a majority Democratic legislature and governors, the average teen birth rate (9.36) is about 1.8 times lower than the average teen birth rate.</li>
